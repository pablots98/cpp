# Test Agent-Based Models
This project contains a basic implementation of agent-based modeling in C++. The model simulates agents interacting in a 2D environment with simple rules for movement and interaction.
## Features 
- Agent Movement: Agents move randomly in a 2D space.
- Interaction: Agents interact with each other based on proximity.
- Basic Visualization: Command-line output visualizes agent behavior.
## Installation 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pablots98/cpp.git
cd cpp/Test_Agent_Based_models
g++ main.cpp -o agent_model
./agent_model
```
